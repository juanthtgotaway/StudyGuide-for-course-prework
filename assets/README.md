## Description

The reason for this project was to test my skills throughout the prework for the bootcamp. This project helps explain some inforamtion on HTML, CSS< and JavaScript. This project was also to help understand how Gitbash works and how the comands have to synchronize with VS code, and GitHub. I learned overall how to use all these programs in unison, making sure to track all my work and how to reference back to older versions.>
